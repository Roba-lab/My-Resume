    <h1>All about me</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>My name is Roba Ejeta, I've been living in the United States of America since November, 2008. <br />I'm originally from the eastern part of Africa, inparticular, Ethiopia: the origin of mankind, <br /> one of the uncolonized countries in the whole Africa, and a country with a thirteen months of sunshine! <br />I am a husband of one wife, and a father of four amazing girls. I love them to death, <br />they are my precious gifts from heaven.  Frankly, I don't have enough words to express my deepest <br />appreciation to my wife, she is beautiful inside outside. Living a life is awesome!</p>

    <p>I am a very motivated ,and dedicated fullstack web developer with over a year of work experience. <br />And developed skills: web designing, web layouts, and develop a modern,and user friendly website for all kinds <br />of businesses. I'm always ready to learn and develop new skills, and love to challenge myself in any <br />work environment. I'm a very quick learner, believe in a team work,friendly to work with, and love <br /> being around people. A hardwork always pays off! </p>

    <p>Where I'll be five or ten years from now? I believe that I'll be one of the best, and influential fullstack <br />web developer in the whole world. And I have a dream that I'll definitely be the CEO of my own Tech company in a near future 	&#128513; 	&#128513; 	&#128513;</p>
